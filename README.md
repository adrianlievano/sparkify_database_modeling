### Purpose

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they collect on songs and user activitiy on their new music streaming application. The analytics team wants to understand which songs users listen most often. There is currently no easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs. In this repository, we create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. We create a database schema and an ETL pipeline for Sparkify.
